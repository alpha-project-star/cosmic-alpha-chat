/**
 * Phase 3I: Authoritative State Ownership, Lifecycle State Machine & Reliability Invariants.
 * 
 * Explicit State Ownership Separation:
 * 1. Reminder State: Owned by ReminderRepository ('active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled').
 * 2. Due State: Determined by ReminderScheduler (dueAt <= now). LLM never determines due state.
 * 3. Due-Event State: Owned by ReminderEventDelivery (deterministic eventId = `due_${reminderId}_${dueAt}`).
 * 4. Proactive Generation State: Owned by ProactiveTrigger ('pending' | 'generating' | 'generated' | 'failed').
 * 5. Notification Delivery State: Owned by NotificationDelivery ('pending' | 'delivering' | 'delivered' | 'failed').
 * 6. Acknowledgement State: Owned by AcknowledgementRepository ('pending' | 'delivered' | 'acknowledged' | 'failed').
 * 7. Recovery State: Owned by NotificationRecovery (read-only query of delivered-but-unacknowledged records).
 * 8. UI State: Non-authoritative cache/representation. Reconciles against authoritative durable state.
